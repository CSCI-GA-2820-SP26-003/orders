This project implements an `orders` microservice that exposes several different operations and endpoints
for use within an ecommerce platform. 

## Overview

The `/service` folder contains relevant models (currently `order.py` and `item.py`), 
as well as a `routes.py` file implementing specific endpoints.

The `/tests` folder contains testing-related code for both the models and routes.

## How To Run
1. Clone this repository into a local directory
2. Ensure that the devcontainers vs code extension is installed, and run `code .` to open the project (`code` may need to be added to `$PATH`)
3. Run `make test` to run tests
4. Run `make run` to run the flask server
5. Navigate to your browser at `http://localhost:8080` to submit requests to the api
